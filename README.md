# [Save the cube] 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TUSK


### Team Members
- Member 1: Karthika T R - Adi Shanara Institute of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
A quirky web game where you watch a realistic ice cube melt and try (and always fail) to save it by blowing on it. Purely for fun and watching the inevitable happen!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody has ever needed to watch an ice cube melt slowly on the internet — but here we are, solving the utterly unnecessary problem of saving a melting ice cube.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a beautifully animated ice cube that melts over time, with a “blow to cool the cube” mini-game that humorously never lets you win. Because sometimes you just gotta accept the drip.
