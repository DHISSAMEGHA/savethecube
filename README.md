# [Save the cube] üéØ

### Project Description
A quirky web game where you watch a realistic ice cube melt and try (and always fail) to save it by blowing on it. Purely for fun and watching the inevitable happen!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody has ever needed to watch an ice cube melt slowly on the internet ‚Äî but here we are, solving the utterly unnecessary problem of saving a melting ice cube.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a beautifully animated ice cube that melts over time, with a ‚Äúblow to cool the cube‚Äù mini-game that humorously never lets you win. Because sometimes you just gotta accept the drip.
